    "[Earlier](cont:sync:sharing:issues), we blamed interrupts for causing untimely context switches that allowed thread operations to be interleaved arbitrarily. So, if we disable interrupts in the `acquire()` function before the critical section, the currently executing thread cannot be kicked off the CPU until it enables interrupts in the `release()` function. Alas, this enticingly simple solution won't work in most cases. First, user-level processes are not allowed to disable interrupts, so this solution is only available to operating system code. Second, leaving interrupts disabled for a long period of time can cause other problems, so even in the OS, it can only be used for short critical sections that do not cause blocking. \n",
    "Third, we can't have different locks protecting different shared data objects if locks are implemented by disabling interrupts, since this approach will prevent other threads from running at all, regardless of what data they might want to access. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, disabling interrupts offers no protection against concurrent accesses from a thread running on another CPU, so this solution can only be applied on a uniprocessor. Historically, disabling interrupts was used to protect short critical sections in OS code, but in the multicore era, this idea has very limited uses.\n",

This solution requires a strict alternation of threads in the critical section. In {numref}`listing:sync:turn` we initialized `turn` so that T0 must go first, but T0 and T1 could have different tasks and run at different relative speeds. If T1 reaches its critical section first, it is still blocked until T0 goes through its critical section and flips `turn` to 1.

J. Dekker for coming up with the first correct solution for two threads (in 1959!).

Unfortunately, an \"unlucky\" thread might always try its test-and-set at an instant when the `locked` flag has been set to `true` by another thread, continually retrying while other threads enter and leave the critical section an unlimited number of times, so we don't have Bounded Waiting with these lock implementations.
