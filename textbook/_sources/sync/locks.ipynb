    "[Earlier](cont:sync:sharing:issues), we blamed interrupts for causing untimely context switches that allowed thread operations to be interleaved arbitrarily. So, if we disable interrupts in the `acquire()` function before the critical section, the currently executing thread cannot be kicked off the CPU until it enables interrupts in the `release()` function. Alas, this enticingly simple solution won't work in most cases. First, user-level processes are not allowed to disable interrupts, so this solution is only available to operating system code. Second, leaving interrupts disabled for a long period of time can cause other problems, so even in the OS, it can only be used for short critical sections that do not cause blocking. \n",
    "Third, we can't have different locks protecting different shared data objects if locks are implemented by disabling interrupts, since this approach will prevent other threads from running at all, regardless of what data they might want to access. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, disabling interrupts offers no protection against concurrent accesses from a thread running on another CPU, so this solution can only be applied on a uniprocessor. Historically, disabling interrupts was used to protect short critical sections in OS code, but in the multicore era, this idea has very limited uses.\n",

This solution requires a strict alternation of threads in the critical section. In {numref}`listing:sync:turn` we initialized `turn` so that T0 must go first, but T0 and T1 could have different tasks and run at different relative speeds. If T1 reaches its critical section first, it is still blocked until T0 goes through its critical section and flips `turn` to 1.

J. Dekker for coming up with the first correct solution for two threads (in 1959!). The main idea is to combine the notion of turns with an expression of interest from a thread when it wants to enter its critical section.

To gain entry to its critical section, a thread first sets its `interested` flag to `true` so that the other thread can see that it wants to enter.

    "Mellor-Crummey and Scott introduced *ticket locks* as a simple way to achieve bounded waiting using an atomic fetch-and-add (FAA) machine instruction {cite}`10.1145/103727.103729`. (The fetch-and-add instruction has the semantics shown in {numref}`listing:sync:faa`.) They observed that ticket locks could be viewed as an optimization of Lamport's classic Bakery Algorithm {cite}`10.1145/361082.361093`. To understand how ticket locks work, imagine a bakery with a ticket dispenser and a display behind the counter showing the ticket number of the next customer to be served. Customers take a ticket when they come into the bakery, and wait until the display shows their number. Customers are served in the order they claim their tickets, so we can guarantee no starvation. \n",

    "To use this idea in a lock data type, we need two counters, `next_ticket` and `now_serving`. To acquire the lock, a thread first gets a ticket and increments the `next_ticket` variable, using the atomic fetch-and-add instruction. Because fetch-and-add is an indivisible machine instruction, each thread is guaranteed a unique ticket number. To wait for its turn, a thread simply spins testing to see if the `now_serving` variable matches its ticket. When that happens, the thread breaks out of the `while` loop, and enters its critical section. To release the lock, a thread simply increments the `now_serving` variable, which will allow exactly one thread (the one holding the next ticket number) to acquire the lock next. We show an example of this implementation in {numref}`listing:sync:ticketlock`. Note that we do not need to use the fetch-and-add atomic instruction to increment `now_serving` in the `release()` function, because only the thread that acquired the lock can release it, and we don't care about the previous value. On any real processor, however, we do need to worry about instruction reordering so we would need a memory *fence* in the `release` function. \n",

    "### Comparing Lock Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "Test-and-set spinlocks, ticket locks, or the mutex from the pthreads library (`pthread_mutex_t`) can all provide mutual exclusion and ensure progress, but ticket locks can guarantee fairness, unlike test-and-set spinlocks. On the other hand, you can see that more work is required to acquire and release a ticket lock. To see how these implementations stack up, we have a very simple test program that creates some number of threads and has each thread count the number of times it can acquire and release the lock in a fixed amount of time. The parent thread sets a global flag to allow the children to start counting after all the threads have been created, sleeps for some amount of time, and then sets another global flag to tell the children to stop. Once all the child threads are done, the parent reports on the total number of iterations completed by all children, and the difference between the most and least productive thread. This program for the test-and-set spinlock is shown in {numref}`listing:sync:check_spinlock_fairness`; we also have versions that replace the spinlock with a ticket lock, and with a pthread mutex.\n",

    "Two things should be readily apparent from these results. First, the pthreads mutex is *much* more efficient than our simple lock implementations, completing nearly twice as many iterations, with an average of nearly 4 million iterations per thread. Second, the pthreads mutex is fairer than the test-and-set spinlock, but less fair than the ticket lock, with the \"fastest\" thread completing ~1.15x more iterations than the \"slowest\" thread. "

    "We can build better spinlocks that are more efficient than the simple implementations we have shown and still satisfy the bounded waiting requirement, but we can't get away from the fundamental problem of busy waiting. On a uniprocessor, busy waiting wastes precious CPU time. If a lock is not available the first time a thread tries to acquire it, the lock can't possibly become available until the thread holding the lock gets a chance to run. So, the waiting thread will spin through its timeslice until the scheduler preempts it and switches to another thread. On a multiprocessor, it might be acceptable to spin while waiting for a lock if critical sections are short, since the lock could be released by a thread running on another CPU. Even on a multiprocessor, however, spinning can waste a lot of CPU time when critical sections are long, or when many threads are competing to acquire the lock. But what alternative do we have? One option is for the waiting thread to voluntarily yield the remainder of its timeslice when it can't acquire a lock (e.g., via the `sched_yield()` system call). This helps, but can still have unnecessary overhead if the thread holding the lock is blocked (e.g., waiting for terminal input). In such cases, the scheduler will keep switching back to the thread trying to acquire the lock, which will keep yielding, until eventually the lock holder can run and release the lock. What we really want is a way to block a thread that is trying to acquire a lock until there is a chance that the lock is available, and then unblock a waiting thread when the lock is released. To that end, we introduce the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sleep(wait_queue)`: blocks the calling thread; thread is added to `wait_queue` and another thread is selected to run.\n",
    "- `wakeup(wait_queue)`: removes a thread from `wait_queue` and adds it to the scheduler Ready queue.\n",
    "- `wakeup_all(wait_queue)`: moves *all* threads from `wait_queue` to the the scheduler Ready queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wait_queue` is simply a data structure that can keep track of the blocked threads. A simple implementation might be a linked list of thread ids that can be used to look up the corresponding thread. We will assume the list is kept in FIFO order, so that the thread that has been waiting the longest will be the first to wake up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this solution to the busy waiting problem just introduced another shared data structure (the `wait_queue`) and the steps to add or remove threads from the wait_queue are themselves critical sections. It looks like we've circled back to the same problem we started with. Fortunately, the operations to add or remove threads from a queue are short, so we can fall back on a spinlock to protect the wait_queue data structure and implement a sleep lock. \n"
