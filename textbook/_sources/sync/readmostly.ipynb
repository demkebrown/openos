    "There are many scenarios in operating systems and other concurrent software where certain data structures are frequently read, but rarely updated. For example, the OS caches network routing information, but route updates are infrequent compared to route lookups in the cache. Since read-only accesses cannot conflict with each other, we would like to allow \"readers\" to execute concurrently with each other (sharing access to the data structure), while \"writers\" must not be allowed to conflict with either readers or other writers. We will look at two ways to solve this problem: classical reader-writer locks (rw_locks), and read-copy-update (RCU). \n",

    "Courtois et al. first described the reader-writer problem and two solutions using semaphores for mutual exclusion in 1971 {cite}`10.1145/362759.362813`. In the first version of the problem, readers have priority over writers: a reader thread should never be prevented from accessing the resource unless a writer has already been granted exclusive use of the resource. We show the solution for this reader-priority version in {numref}`listing:sync:readmostly:readerpri` using POSIX semaphores. Note that since the semaphores are used only for mutual exclusion, we could replace them with `pthread_mutex_t` or any of our spinlock implementations without making any other changes. We represent access to some shared database with the `read_db()` and `write_db()` functions. \n",

    "The writer code (lines 11-13) is very simple. We introduce a `mutex` semaphore (line 4) to protect access to the shared data. The `wait` on `mutex` at line 11 ensures that only one writer can be accessing the data at any time; when the writer is done, it `post`s a notice to `mutex` that the data is now available again (line 13). In previous locking scenarios, the reader code would be symmetrical, with each reader also waiting for the `mutex` and `post`ing when it was done. Because we want to allow multiple readers, the reader code needs to do a little more work, however. First, we want to keep track of the number of readers currently accessing the data, so we introduce a `reader_count` variable (line 7), and since this variable will be updated by every reader thread, we also add a `counter_mutex` semaphore (line 5) to protect sections of code that depend on the `reader_count`. Each reader thread begins by `wait`ing for the `counter_mutex`, then increments `reader_count` to add itself to the count of current readers (lines 19-20). Only the first reader thread needs to synchronize with writer threads (lines 21-24)---once a reader has successfully `wait`ed for the `mutex`, writers will be locked out until all the readers are done. Notice also that the first reader does not `post` to the `counter_mutex` until *after* it has obtained permission to access the data (line 25). This ensures that other reader threads must line up `wait`ing for the `counter_mutex` as long as a writer is accessing the data. When a reader finishes using the data, it must again `wait` for the `counter_mutex` to subtract itself from the count of current readers (lines 29-30). When the `reader_count` falls to zero, it means that the last reader thread is done using the data, and this last thread must `post` a signal to the `mutex` to indicate that the data is available again (lines 31-34). If any writers are waiting, one will be allowed to proceed.\n",
