    "Running multiple operating system instances on the same physical\n",
    "hardware serves a number of purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running multiple operating systems:** Many applications are tied to a\n",
    "specific OS or even OS version; by using virtual machines it is possible\n",
    "to run instances of these other operating systems and make these\n",
    "applications availabe to a user without requiring extra hardware. (As an\n",
    "example, the laptop I am typing on runs Apple's OS X, but I have a\n",
    "virtual machine running Ubuntu Linux for Linux development.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Configurations:** Even applications which run on the same\n",
    "operating system may need to run on different machines, rather than just\n",
    "in separate processes. This may be because they require different,\n",
    "incompatible versions of system libraries, or different configuration\n",
    "options. In some cases (e.g. running an old and new version of the same\n",
    "application) they may need different versions of the same configuration\n",
    "files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporting multiple configurations is frequently called *server\n",
    "consolidation*, as in the past an enterprise may have needed to use\n",
    "multiple physical machines to provide these configurations. Frequently\n",
    "the load on each service or configuration was much less than what could\n",
    "be handled by a single machine, and many of these services can instead\n",
    "be deployed as virtual machines on a single physical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security:** Many applications (e.g. webservers, databases) require\n",
    "administrative privileges (e.g. root on Unix) for configuration. In the\n",
    "past these applications were typically considered infrastructure\n",
    "services, maintained and configured by system administrators at the\n",
    "request of users. However in many recent cases (e.g. Amazon's Elastic\n",
    "Compute Cloud) the customer is expected to perform all configuration and\n",
    "management, and multiple untrusted customers may share the same physical\n",
    "hardware. Instead of being provided an unprivileged login on a shared\n",
    "machine, each customer is given a virtual machine which they can\n",
    "configure as they wish, with full root or administrative privileges,\n",
    "without posing a threat to customers on other virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{sidebar} \n",
    "12 Operating system *containers*, such as those used by Docker, provide\n",
    "many of the advantages of virtual machines while using a single\n",
    "operating system. Each container is a set of processes with a\n",
    "*namespace* of process IDs and network connections, and a separate file\n",

    "using operating system-level protections. (This would of course\n",
    "eliminate the need to use any other less perfect operating system.)\n",

    "## Implementing Hardware Virtualization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are used to running VirtualBox or VMware on your laptop, it may\n",
    "seem like it's just another program, maybe using more memory and CPU\n",
    "than most. But it isn't. To understand why, consider trying to run Linux\n",
    "(the \"guest\" operating system) on top of a \"host\" operating system, e.g.\n",
    "Windows. The linux kernel is an executable file, typically found in\n",
    "`/boot/vmlinux`, and could be readily translated into a Windows\n",
    "executable. However if you tried to do this[^3] it would crash\n",
    "immediately. Some of the reasons an operating system kernel cannot run\n",
    "as a process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Privileged instructions:** One of the first things the kernel does on\n",
    "startup is to initialize the virtual memory system, mapping virtual\n",
    "addresses to physical addresses. This configuration requires\n",
    "privileged-mode instructions, which are inaccessible to user-mode\n",
    "applications, as they could be used to bypass operating system\n",
    "protections. The first such instruction executed by the guest OS would\n",
    "cause an exception, killing the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interference:** The problem isn't just that the guest OS won't be\n",
    "allowed to modify virtual address mappings. If it actually could modify\n",
    "these mappings, then the underlying host operating system would almost\n",
    "certainly crash, as it assumes that it has complete control over them.\n",
    "The CPU only has a single address translation mechanism, and if two\n",
    "operating systems are going to make use of it, they must either\n",
    "deliberately share access, or it must be virtualized before being used\n",
    "by one or both OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security:** Secure isolation between virtual machines, including\n",
    "memory protection, is at least as important as isolation between\n",
    "processes in a normal operating system. But if a guest operating system\n",
    "has direct access to the CPU address translation mechanisms it can\n",
    "easily access physical memory allocated to another virtual machine (or\n",
    "to the host OS itself), bypassing any security mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I/O:** A process running under Linux or Windows uses *system calls*\n",
    "such as **open** and **read** to access *files*. In contrast, an\n",
    "operating system uses *drivers* to access *physical devices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this chapter we discuss the following approaches to\n",
    "supporting virtual machines, arranged (roughly) in increasing order of\n",
    "both complexity and performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software emulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emulation with binary translation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Paravirtualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to run a virtual machine is to emulate it\n",
    "entirely in software: in other words, to write a program that behaves\n",
    "exactly like the CPU, memory, and I/O devices of the real machine. The\n",
    "idea is simple: given a complete description of how the CPU behaves,\n",
    "create variables for the registers and a big array for memory, and write\n",
    "a program that repeatedly fetches instructions from the memory array,\n",
    "decodes them, and emulates their operation, much like the sample code in\n",
    "[\\[fig:vma:1\\]](#fig:vma:1){reference-type=\"autoref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:vma:1\"}.\n",

    "\n",
    "Full software emulation is simple conceptually, although in practice the\n",
    "list of instructions to implement can get long (over 1000 on modern x86\n",
    "CPUs) and complex. It has one major advantage, portability: once the\n",
    "code to emulate a specific CPU is written, it can be compiled and run on\n",
    "almost any host. This is especially useful in embedded development,\n",
    "where it is often necessary to develop and test software before the CPU\n",
    "(or at least the system incorporating that CPU) is ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary disadvantage is performance---full software emulation is\n",
    "slow. It can be hundreds of times slower than native execution, making\n",
    "it unsuited for all but a few applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emulation plus binary translation\n",
    "\n",
    "```{sidebar} \n",
    "Other software systems which use binary translation techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**JVMs:** Almost all Java implementations use JIT compiling for\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Javascript:** Recent browsers (Safari, Firefox, and others) use\n",
    "just-in-time compilation to improve Javascript performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Software interpreters can be sped up by what Java developers call Just\n",
    "In Time (JIT) compilation, and which CPU emulator developers call Binary\n",
    "Translation. The idea is to translate commonly-used fragments of code\n",
    "into actual machine code, which can usually run far faster than pure\n",
    "emulation. (In part, it eliminates the software-implemented instruction\n",
    "fetch and decode for each instruction, which is a significant overhead.)\n",
    "An example can be seen in\n",
    "[\\[fig:vma:2\\]](#fig:vma:2){reference-type=\"autoref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:vma:2\"}.\n",

    "       MUL  2,R3  -> R3\n",

    "```\n",
    "       LOAD Rx <- &emulated_R1     \n",
    "       LOAD Ry <- &emulated_R2\n",
    "       LOAD Rz <- &emulated_R3\n",
    "       ADD Rx,Ry -> Ry             \n",

    "       RET                          \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the following occurs when a section of binary-translated\n",
    "code is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The real CPU registers are loaded from the virtual (i.e., software-emulated) registers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The translated instructions are executed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The virtual CPU state is updated with results from the real CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases the translator will produce more than one instruction per\n",
    "emulated instruction. Memory accesses are particularly tricky, as the\n",
    "generated code must emulate address translation performed by the MMU,\n",
    "and then check to see whether the resulting address is I/O or RAM before\n",
    "performing the operation. In practice it may be possible to arrange\n",
    "emulator memory (using e.g. the `mmap` system call) so that most memory\n",
    "accesses can be performed directly; in this case the overhead for most\n",
    "memory accesses can be reduced to a few instructions which check that an\n",
    "access falls within this typical range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trap and Emulate\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with binary translation, software emulation is still slow---even\n",
    "the best binary translation systems incur a slowdown of 3x to 10x\n",
    "compared to running directly on the same hardware. This is much better\n",
    "than unoptimized software emulation, and may be the best that can be\n",
    "done when emulating one CPU on top of a CPU running a different\n",
    "instruction set. (e.g. running iPhone or Android applications on an\n",
    "Intel-based laptop or desktop, or the Rosetta emulator which Apple used\n",
    "to allow PowerPC applications to run seamlessly on early Intel-based\n",
    "Macintosh systems.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However In many other cases---such as VirtualBox running on my\n",
    "laptop---the CPU emulated by the virtual machine is the same as the\n",
    "real, physical CPU. In this case we can improve performance greatly by\n",
    "using *direct execution* when possible: executing instructions directly\n",
    "on the physical CPU. The only reason we were emulating instructions in\n",
    "the first place was because the host OS could not allow a virtual\n",
    "machine to directly execute certain privileged instructions, so the goal\n",
    "here is to emulate only these privileged instructions while directly\n",
    "executing all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done[^4] using a strategy that can be called\n",
    "*trap-and-emulate*. The guest OS is executed directly in user mode; when\n",
    "it executes a privileged instruction it causes an exception which is\n",
    "handled by a specialized OS called a *hypervisor* or *virtual machine\n",
    "monitor*. The hypervisor loads the user-visible CPU registers into the\n",
    "software CPU emulation, runs it for a single instruction, and then\n",
    "returns back to direct execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to compare a hypervisor running a guest OS (and guest\n",
    "applications) with a traditional operating system running multiple\n",
    "processes. A normal OS virtualizes CPU, memory, and other resources to\n",
    "provide a virtual machine abstraction to each process: each process sees\n",
    "its own memory space and a CPU which can execute user-mode instructions\n",
    "and a special system call instruction. A hypervisor, in contrast,\n",
    "performs a similar task of virtualizing memory and CPU, but provides a\n",
    "virtual machine abstraction which is identical to that of the hardware\n",
    "itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Trap-and-emulate virtualization](../images/virt/virtual-mach-3.png){#fig:vma:3 width=\"90%\"}\n",

    "reference=\"fig:vma:3\"} shows a representation of this trap-and-emulate\n",
    "process. It allows almost all instructions to run directly, at native\n",
    "hardware speed, while the specific instructions which need to be\n",

    "But how does a hypervisor handle exceptions? An operating system relies\n",

    "page fault, or a timer or I/O device interrupt. Since the guest OS runs\n",
    "in user mode, exceptions such as system calls or page faults generated\n",
    "by guest applications will be delivered to the hypervisor rather than\n",
    "the guest OS. The solution is for the hypervisor to just emulate the\n",
    "real CPU operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the emulated supervisor bit to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (with the emulated CPU) Handle user/supervisor stack switch, pushing\n",
    "registers, and all the other exception-handling mechanisms that take up\n",
    "so many pages in the CPU reference manuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return to user mode, load user-visible registers from the emulated CPU, and call the guest OS exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When the guest exception handler returns, set the emulated supervisor\n",
    "bit to 0, restore user registers from the kernel stack, switch to user\n",
    "stack, then jump back to direct execution at the instruction where the\n",
    "exception occurred[^5].\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it know where to find that exception handler? The hardware CPU\n",
    "locates exception handlers via one or more control registers which point\n",
    "to interrupt descriptors which are located in memory. (e.g in\n",
    "Intel-compatible CPUS the `IDTR` register, which points to the\n",
    "*interrupt descriptor table*) These registers may only be accessed in\n",

    "Memory-mapped I/O devices are straightforward to emulate in a\n",
    "trap-and-emulate system. When the guest OS maps the physical memory\n",
    "addresses of emulated device registers, the hypervisor leaves the\n",
    "corresponding pages unmapped in the shadow table, so that all read and\n",
    "write accesses will result in a page fault. The hypervisor page fault\n",
    "handler handles faults on these pages specially, calling code that\n",
    "emulates reading from or writing to the emulated I/O device.\n",

    "\n",
    "In [\\[fig:vma:5\\]](#fig:vma:5){reference-type=\"autoref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:vma:5\"} you can see how this works together. Exceptions\n",
    "from user applications (page faults, system calls, etc.) are handled by\n",
    "the hypervisor, which in most cases passes them to the guest OS.\n",
    "Interrupts from I/O devices are passed to drivers in the hypervisor,\n",
    "which may in turn decide that it's time for a virtual hardware device to\n",

    "\n",
    "This image describes server systems (like VMware ESX), where the machine\n",
    "boots the hypervisor instead of a regular OS, and does nothing but run\n",
    "virtual machines. But what about a \"hosted\" system like VirtualBox or\n",
    "VMware Workstation? In particular, how does it run \"on top of\" a host\n",
    "OS?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, it doesn't. When you install VirtualBox it installs\n",
    "a set of drivers, which (like normal hardware drivers) run as part of\n",
    "the kernel, in supervisor mode. When a virtual machine starts running,\n",
    "these drivers insert themselves under the host operating system,\n",
    "\"stealing\" exceptions such as page faults and system calls whenever a\n",
    "virtual machine is executing, and forwarding them to the hypervisor.\n",
    "Running on the same system as a host operating system has its\n",
    "advantages, though, as the host OS has drivers for all of its hardware,\n",
    "a file system, display, and other useful interfaces. A hosted hypervisor\n",
    "can take advantage of this, passing I/O requests back to the host OS\n",
    "(via a rather complicated route) to be handled through these standard\n",

    "## Non-Virtualizable CPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a minor problem with the classic trap-and-emulate\n",
    "virtualization mechanism as described above: it doesn't work. Or rather,\n",
    "it doesn't work on the machines you want it to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform classic virtualization to work, every \"sensitive\"\n",
    "instruction (in other words, one that has to be emulated, like loading\n",
    "CR3 to switch page tables) must trap so that it can be emulated by the\n",
    "hypervisor. Unfortunately, some CPU architectures (in particular, Intel\n",
    "x86 CPUs) have instructions that fail this requirement. For example, on\n",
    "x86 CPUs, a number of instructions which modify supervisor-mode state\n",
    "will silently do nothing when executed in user mode, rather than causing\n",
    "an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sensitive state in the Intel architecture EFLAGS register](../images/virt/eflags-register.png){#fig:virtmach:eflags}\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the EFLAGS register as shown in\n",
    "[\\[fig:virtmach:eflags\\]](#fig:virtmach:eflags){reference-type=\"autoref\"\n",
    "reference=\"fig:virtmach:eflags\"} contains some commonly-used flags such\n",
    "as carry (CF) and zero (ZF) which it inherited from the 16-bit 8086, as\n",
    "well as system flags such as interrupt enable and \"IO privilege level\",\n",
    "the CPU user/supervisor privilege level. The POPF instruction modifies\n",
    "this register, by loading it with a value popped from the top of the\n",
    "stack. To prevent application code from arbitrarily disabling interrupts\n",
    "or turning on supervisor mode, when POPF is executed in user mode it\n",
    "silently ignores any privileged bits like IOPL and interrupt enable;\n",
    "when kernel code executes POPF in supervisor mode, these bits are loaded\n",
    "with new values. If we try to run the kernel in user mode this\n",
    "instruction will silently do the wrong thing, rather than trapping into\n",
    "the hypervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions like this complicate the task of performing efficient\n",
    "virtualization, but it is still possible, using one of three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Emulation with binary translation:** This is the simplest approach to\n",
    "describe, although rather difficult to implement well. Whenever the\n",
    "guest transitions into supervisor mode (for example, for a system call\n",
    "or an interrupt) the hypervisor emulates all instructions in software,\n",
    "using binary to translation speed up this process, and only resuming\n",
    "direct execution when the guest returns to user mode. This is slower for\n",
    "normal instructions in the kernel, but faster for privileged\n",
    "instructions, as it can translate them once instead of incurring the\n",
    "overhead of trapping and emulating each privileged instruction every\n",
    "time it executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hardware virtualization:** Modern x86 CPUs include virtualization\n",
    "extensions, which add a third privilege level more powerful than\n",
    "supervisor mode. The guest runs in normal user and supervisor mode, but\n",
    "certain instructions trap into hypervisor mode for emulation, just as in\n",
    "trap-and-emulate virtualization on a virtualizable CPU. Which\n",
    "instructions? It depends: there are configuration registers providing\n",
    "the hypervisor with a menu of which operations it wants to intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Paravirtualization:** rather than providing complete emulation of the\n",
    "hardware platform, the hypervisor provides an OS-like interface so that\n",
    "the operating system can request operations (e.g. address space switch)\n",
    "which would be performed by hardware instructions (e.g. LOAD CR3) on\n",
    "bare hardware. The guest operating system must be modified to use these\n",
    "requests, and so while binary translation and hardware virtualization\n",
    "can run unmodified guest operating systems (e.g. standard Windows\n",
    "installation media) paravirtualization can only support guest operating\n",
    "systems which have been modified for paravirtualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes required in a guest OS are actually not that extensive, as\n",
    "most modern operating systems (even Windows) are structured so that they\n",
    "can be (relatively) easily modified to support different machine types,\n",
    "with hardware-specific portions isolated into a small, replaceable part\n",
    "of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A paravirtualized hypervisor looks sort of like a regular OS: it runs in\n",
    "supervisor mode, with guests running in user mode making requests via\n",
    "system calls using TRAP instructions. Unlike a normal OS, however, these\n",
    "system calls perform hardware-level operations like loading a page\n",
    "table, allocating physical memory, or installing a page fault handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{sidebar} \n",
    "If you're curious, the Linux code to switch address spaces can be found\n",
    "in the `activate_mm` macro in\n",
    "[arch/x86/include/asm/context.h](arch/x86/include/asm/context.h){.uri}.\n",
    "On regular hardware it calls `switch_mm` which executes a `LOAD CR3`\n",
    "instruction; in paravirtualized mode it calls `paravirt_activate_mm` (in\n",
    "[arch/x86/include/asm/](arch/x86/include/asm/){.uri}[paravirt.h](paravirt.h){.uri})\n",

    "operation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although paravirtualization requires some modifications to the guest OS,\n",
    "in some cases it provides higher performance. As an example, the\n",
    "hypervisor interface can be as efficient as a system call, while\n",
    "hardware virtualization extensions require many cycles to trap, decode,\n",
    "and emulate each instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years Amazon EC2 used a modified version of the Xen paravirtualized\n",
    "hypervisor, although as hardware virtualization support continues to\n",
    "improve, this remains the case only for a small number of their instance\n",
    "types.\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of virtualization is fastest? This is actually a hard\n",
    "question---putting something (like virtualization support) into hardware\n",
    "doesn't automatically make it faster. State-of-the-art hardware and\n",
    "software-based (binary translation) hypervisors can have equivalent\n",
    "performance[^7], so the choice between them often comes down to\n",
    "features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paravirtualized I/O Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for hypervisors to have optional drivers (VMware Tools,\n",
    "VirtualBox Guest Additions, etc.) which can be loaded in the guest to\n",
    "improve performance. These typically include paravirtualized drivers for\n",
    "the disk controller and network interface: rather than catching writes\n",
    "to emulated registers, the paravirtualized driver uses a system\n",
    "call-like interface to make I/O requests to the hypervisor. Note that\n",
    "this works because almost all operating systems provide a simple means\n",
    "to load arbitrary kernel-mode drivers for third-party hardware; a\n",
    "paravirtualized device is just another piece of (virtualized) hardware\n",
    "that you need to install a driver for. In contrast, operating systems\n",
    "writers don't typically anticipate the need to support plugging in a\n",
    "different type of CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux Containers and Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Running different applications within separate virtual machines provides\n",
    "a number of benefits when compared to running them all on the same\n",
    "unvirtualized operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Security---if one application is compromised, or is untrusted, the only\n",
    "way for it to attack the other applications (other than via the external\n",
    "network) is by subverting the hypervisor. This is difficult, as they are\n",
    "small and have tended to be quite reliable in practice. (i.e. with few\n",
    "bugs that can be exploited)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance isolation---server-class virtualization systems can enforce\n",
    "resource limits (memory, CPU time, disk and network I/O) which ensure\n",
    "that heavy loads on one application do not negatively impact another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Management isolation---each virtual machine has its own file system,\n",
    "administrative (root) account, installed libraries, etc. and can be\n",
    "configured without regard to the dependencies of other applications\n",
    "running in other virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Packaging convenience---a virtual machine image is a convenient and\n",
    "useful format for storing a virtual machine and all of its\n",
    "configuration, as well as for distributing it to others. (like the\n",
    "CS-5600 virtual machine image you received at the beginning of this\n",
    "class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that none of these benefits actually *requires* hardware\n",
    "virtualization[^8]. If all of the applications are going to be running\n",
    "on the same operating system, then *Operating System Virtualization* can\n",
    "be used: rather than pretending that a single hardware machine is\n",
    "actually multiple virtual machines, we pretend that a single instance of\n",
    "the operating system is actually multiple instances. This approach was\n",
    "first used in FreeBSD *jails* and Solaris *containers*, but the mostly\n",
    "widely known example today is Linux Containers (LXC) and Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "LXC allows the creation of isolated process groups: each process in such\n",
    "a group (and any children of those processes) thinks that the group has\n",
    "the entire operating system to itself. This is done via two mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Namespaces** - in recent Linux versions, any access to the file\n",
    "system, process ID, networking, user or group IDs, or several more\n",
    "obscure system parameters (e.g. hostname) is relative to a *namespace*.\n",
    "In a normal system with no containers there will be a single namespace,\n",
    "visible to all processes. (or at least those that have sufficient\n",
    "permission, in the case of e.g. file system access) However you can also\n",
    "create new namespaces, with a restricted view of the file system (e.g.\n",
    "only able to see a small subtree), with their own process ID space and\n",
    "user names and IDs, and separate network interfaces and addresses.\n",
    "Within a namespace you can have a root user which can perform privileged\n",
    "operations within the namespace, but which has no power or visibility\n",
    "outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control groups (cgroups)** - these are used to control operating\n",
    "system allocation of resources such as memory, CPU time, or disk and\n",
    "network bandwidth. A cgroup can be associated with a process group, and\n",
    "the process group as a whole will be subject to any limits (e.g. on\n",
    "memory, CPU time, etc.) placed on that cgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these two features allows the creation of separate\n",
    "*containers*, each with its own file system, network interfaces, etc.,\n",
    "and where processes within a container are isolated from those in other\n",
    "containers or in the \"base\" or root operating system within which these\n",
    "containers were created. Processes in a container interact with the OS\n",
    "kernel in exactly the same way as in a non-containerized system; the\n",
    "only difference is in what they *see*, which is controlled via\n",
    "namespaces, and how their CPU time and I/O are *scheduled*, which is\n",
    "controlled via cgroups. Containers are thus more efficient, as there is\n",
    "no virtualization overhead, and can be created almost as quickly as\n",
    "normal processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is still a single operating system kernel, all containers in\n",
    "a system share the same operating system version. Note, however, that\n",
    "they may have entirely different file systems; thus it is quite possible\n",
    "to have both a Red Hat and an Ubuntu distribution running in separate\n",
    "containers on the same machine, although each will be using the kernel\n",
    "of the underlying system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is based on LXC; however perhaps its main innovation is the way\n",
    "in which it manages container file systems. A Docker container uses a\n",
    "*union file system* to join together multiple file systems---the first\n",
    "one of which is writeable, and with one or more read-only ones \"behind\"\n",
    "it. To understand the operation of a union file system, consider how the\n",
    "Unix shell finds an executable: it searches each directory in the PATH\n",
    "variable in order, and takes the first version of the file that it\n",
    "finds. Thus if the value of PATH is `/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`, and you type\n",
    "`ls`, it will search `/usr/bin/ls` (not found), `/sbin/ls` (not found),\n",
    "and then `/bin/ls` (successful). A union file system operates in a\n",
    "similar fashion: on read access to a file (or directory) it will search\n",
    "through each underlying file system in order until it is found. When\n",
    "writing to a file, however, it will write to the first writable file\n",
    "system in the list, providing a form of copy-on-write.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows various environments to be *stacked*: e.g. a base file\n",
    "system containing the files from a minimal Linux installation, with\n",
    "additional file systems \"on top\" of it containing installed versions of\n",
    "various packages one wishes to use, and a writable file system on top\n",
    "for per-instance configuration parameters, application data, etc.\n",
