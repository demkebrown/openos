The top figure uses internal pointers in a block, where each block stores slightly less than a full block of data.  This approach doesn't have the external fragmentation challenge of contiguous files.  However, it is not practical, since the block size is no longer a power of 2, many reads in the operating system are for blocks of code and reading an extra block is inefficient.  Also, to find a single block, one has to read sequentially through the entire linked list. \n",
