    "As we discussed in the [file system abstractions](cont:fs:interface:dir), the name space is created by having directories, where a directory as show in {numref}`fs:tree-imp:rep`, is just another file that has strings and information about the files those strings represent.  \n",

    "Implementation view: hierarchical file system name space. Gray blocks are directories that contain entries with strings and corresponding inode numbers that identify the files.\n",

    "\n",
    "A simple way to implement such a directory ({numref}`directory1`a), is to have a fixed array of data structures, where each entry has room for a fixed sized string, and the attributes of the file such as permissions, owner, and location of file on disk.  This approach is used in the MS-DOS, and CDROM file systems described earlier.  With these file systems, there is only one name for each file, and attributes identify if an entry is valid or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For unix file systems, the directory typically does not contain the attributes, but instead contains an inode number ({numref}`directory1`b) that identifies the inode that contains those attributes; enabling multiple directory entries to reference the same file.  The separation of name (i.e. directory entry) and attributes (the inode and the blocks it points to) allows files to have multiple names, which for historical reasons are called hard links.  \n",

    "The directory structure above could be implemented with the following data structure:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct dentry {\n",
    "    // inode number\n",
    "    unsigned int inode;\n",
    "    // file name, max 252 chars\n",
    "    char name[252];\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "Supporting files with string names that can be up to 252 characters, and a directory entry, assuming 4 byte integers, that is 256 characters.  When searching for a file,  the directory block(s) are memory and a linear search through the entries is used to locate the file.  The alignment to 256 characters (i.e., the somewhat strange lenght of the string name) ensures that when the entry is loaded into memory, the 4 byte inode is aligned to 4 bytes; so the processor can load it with a single memory load.\n",
    "A simple fixed sized data structure like this is easy to manage, a new file is added by searching for an entry with an invalid attribute, and deleting a file just sets the attribute to invalid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the above data structure, all files are limited to at most 252 characters, and more importantly, you are wasting a great deal of space for most files that have small names.  More sophisticated file systems, use structures like the ext2 file system shown below: \n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct ext2_dir_entry {\n",
    "    // inode number\n",
    "    unsigned int   inode;\n",
    "    // directory entry length\n",
    "    unsigned short rec_len;\n",
    "    // name length\n",
    "    unsigned char  name_len;  \n",
    "    // file type\n",
    "    unsigned char  file_type;\n",
    "    // file name, max 255 chars\n",
    "    char           name[];\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the name of the file is variable length, with the length of the spring specified by ```name_len```.  The ```rec_len``` describes how big the record is.  The ```rec_len``` may include padding to ensure that entries are aligned to 4 byte boundaries. The last entry's ```rec_len``` can be set to the remainder of the size of the directory block, and if a file is unlinked from a directory, the previous entry's ```rec_len``` can be padded by the size of the record being removed.  This enables the file system to add a new file to the directory by comparing the ```rec_len``` and the ```name_len``` to identify if there is enough unused space between the used part of a directory entry and the next to insert the file. \n"
